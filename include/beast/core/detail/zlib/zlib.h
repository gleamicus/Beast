/*
    The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed data.
  This version of the library supports only one compression method (deflation)
  but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same stream
  interface.

    Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough,
  or can be done by repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter
  case, the application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

    The compressed data format used by default by the in-memory functions is
  the zlib format, which is a zlib wrapper documented in RFC 1950, wrapped
  around a deflate stream, which is itself documented in RFC 1951.

    The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format
  with an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start
  with "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a
  gzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.

    This library can optionally read and write gzip streams in memory as well.

    The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory
  and on communications channels.  The gzip format was designed for single-
  file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
  directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.

    The library does not install any signal handler.  The decoder checks
  the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never crash
  even in case of corrupted input.

     The application must update next_in and avail_in when avail_in has dropped

   to zero.  The application must initialize zalloc, zfree and opaque before
   calling the init function.  All other fields are set by the compression
   library and must not be updated by the application.

     The opaque value provided by the application will be passed as the first
   parameter for calls of zalloc and zfree.  This can be useful for custom
   memory management.  The compression library attaches no meaning to the
   opaque value.

     zalloc must return Z_NULL if there is not enough memory for the object.
   If zlib is used in a multi-threaded application, zalloc and zfree must be
   thread safe.

     On 16-bit systems, the functions zalloc and zfree must be able to allocate
   exactly 65536 bytes, but will not be required to allocate more than this if
   the symbol MAXSEG_64K is defined (see zconf.h).  To reduce memory requirements
   and avoid any allocation of 64K objects, at the expense of compression ratio,
   compile the library with -DMAX_WBITS=14 (see zconf.h).

     The fields total_in and total_out can be used for statistics or progress
   reports.  After compression, total_in holds the total size of the
   uncompressed data and may be saved for use in the decompressor (particularly
   if the decompressor wants to decompress everything in a single step).

extern int deflateInit (z_streamp strm, int level);

     Initializes the internal stream state for compression.  The fields
   zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by the caller.  If
   zalloc and zfree are set to Z_NULL, deflateInit updates them to use default
   allocation functions.

     The compression level must be Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION, or between 0 and 9:
   1 gives best speed, 9 gives best compression, 0 gives no compression at all
   (the input data is simply copied a block at a time).  Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION
   requests a default compromise between speed and compression (currently
   equivalent to level 6).

     deflateInit returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if level is not a valid compression level, or
   Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version (zlib_version) is incompatible
   with the version assumed by the caller (ZLIB_VERSION).  msg is set to null
   if there is no error message.  deflateInit does not perform any compression:
   this will be done by deflate().
*/


extern int deflate (z_streamp strm, int flush);
/*
    deflate compresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full.  It may introduce
  some output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.

    The detailed semantics are as follows.  deflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Compress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly.  If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in and avail_in are updated and
    processing will resume at this point for the next call of deflate().

  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  This action is forced if the parameter flush is non zero.
    Forcing flush frequently degrades the compression ratio, so this parameter
    should be set only when necessary (in interactive applications).  Some
    output may be provided even if flush is not set.

    Before the call of deflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming more
  output, and updating avail_in or avail_out accordingly; avail_out should
  never be zero before the call.  The application can consume the compressed
  output when it wants, for example when the output buffer is full (avail_out
  == 0), or after each call of deflate().  If deflate returns Z_OK and with
  zero avail_out, it must be called again after making room in the output
  buffer because there might be more output pending.

    Normally the parameter flush is set to Z_NO_FLUSH, which allows deflate to
  decide how much data to accumulate before producing output, in order to
  maximize compression.

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_SYNC_FLUSH, all pending output is
  flushed to the output buffer and the output is aligned on a byte boundary, so
  that the decompressor can get all input data available so far.  (In
  particular avail_in is zero after the call if enough output space has been
  provided before the call.) Flushing may degrade compression for some
  compression algorithms and so it should be used only when necessary.  This
  completes the current deflate block and follows it with an empty stored block
  that is three bits plus filler bits to the next byte, followed by four bytes
  (00 00 ff ff).

    If flush is set to Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, all pending output is flushed to the
  output buffer, but the output is not aligned to a byte boundary.  All of the
  input data so far will be available to the decompressor, as for Z_SYNC_FLUSH.
  This completes the current deflate block and follows it with an empty fixed
  codes block that is 10 bits long.  This assures that enough bytes are output
  in order for the decompressor to finish the block before the empty fixed code
  block.

    If flush is set to Z_BLOCK, a deflate block is completed and emitted, as
  for Z_SYNC_FLUSH, but the output is not aligned on a byte boundary, and up to
  seven bits of the current block are held to be written as the next byte after
  the next deflate block is completed.  In this case, the decompressor may not
  be provided enough bits at this point in order to complete decompression of
  the data provided so far to the compressor.  It may need to wait for the next
  block to be emitted.  This is for advanced applications that need to control
  the emission of deflate blocks.

    If flush is set to Z_FULL_FLUSH, all output is flushed as with
  Z_SYNC_FLUSH, and the compression state is reset so that decompression can
  restart from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if
  random access is desired.  Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often can seriously degrade
  compression.

    If deflate returns with avail_out == 0, this function must be called again
  with the same value of the flush parameter and more output space (updated
  avail_out), until the flush is complete (deflate returns with non-zero
  avail_out).  In the case of a Z_FULL_FLUSH or Z_SYNC_FLUSH, make sure that
  avail_out is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to
  avail_out == 0 on return.

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed,
  pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there was
  enough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be
  called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no
  more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error.  After
  deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations on the stream
  are deflateReset or deflateEnd.

    Z_FINISH can be used immediately after deflateInit if all the compression
  is to be done in a single step.  In this case, avail_out must be at least the
  value returned by deflateBound (see below).  Then deflate is guaranteed to
  return Z_STREAM_END.  If not enough output space is provided, deflate will
  not return Z_STREAM_END, and it must be called again as described above.

    deflate() sets strm->adler to the adler32 checksum of all input read
  so far (that is, total_in bytes).

    deflate() may update strm->data_type if it can make a good guess about
  the input data type (Z_BINARY or Z_TEXT).  In doubt, the data is considered
  binary.  This field is only for information purposes and does not affect the
  compression algorithm in any manner.

    deflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input
  processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if all input has been
  consumed and all output has been produced (only when flush is set to
  Z_FINISH), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state was inconsistent (for example
  if next_in or next_out was Z_NULL), Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible
  (for example avail_in or avail_out was zero).  Note that Z_BUF_ERROR is not
  fatal, and deflate() can be called again with more input and more output
  space to continue compressing.

extern int deflateEnd (z_streamp strm);
/*
     All dynamically allocated data structures for this stream are freed.
   This function discards any unprocessed input and does not flush any pending
   output.

     deflateEnd returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the
   stream state was inconsistent, Z_DATA_ERROR if the stream was freed
   prematurely (some input or output was discarded).  In the error case, msg
   may be set but then points to a static string (which must not be
   deallocated).
*/


/*
extern int inflateInit (z_streamp strm);

     Initializes the internal stream state for decompression.  The fields
   next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by
   the caller.  If next_in is not Z_NULL and avail_in is large enough (the
   exact value depends on the compression method), inflateInit determines the
   compression method from the zlib header and allocates all data structures
   accordingly; otherwise the allocation will be deferred to the first call of
   inflate.  If zalloc and zfree are set to Z_NULL, inflateInit updates them to
   use default allocation functions.

     inflateInit returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible with the
   version assumed by the caller, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the parameters are
   invalid, such as a null pointer to the structure.  msg is set to null if
   there is no error message.  inflateInit does not perform any decompression
   apart from possibly reading the zlib header if present: actual decompression
   will be done by inflate().  (So next_in and avail_in may be modified, but
   next_out and avail_out are unused and unchanged.) The current implementation
   of inflateInit() does not process any header information -- that is deferred
   until inflate() is called.
*/


extern int inflate (z_streamp strm, int flush);
/*
    inflate decompresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full.  It may introduce
  some output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.

  The detailed semantics are as follows.  inflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Decompress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly.  If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in is updated and processing will
    resume at this point for the next call of inflate().

  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  inflate() provides as much output as possible, until there is
    no more input data or no more space in the output buffer (see below about
    the flush parameter).

    Before the call of inflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming more
  output, and updating the next_* and avail_* values accordingly.  The
  application can consume the uncompressed output when it wants, for example
  when the output buffer is full (avail_out == 0), or after each call of
  inflate().  If inflate returns Z_OK and with zero avail_out, it must be
  called again after making room in the output buffer because there might be
  more output pending.

    The flush parameter of inflate() can be Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, Z_FINISH,
  Z_BLOCK, or Z_TREES.  Z_SYNC_FLUSH requests that inflate() flush as much
  output as possible to the output buffer.  Z_BLOCK requests that inflate()
  stop if and when it gets to the next deflate block boundary.  When decoding
  the zlib or gzip format, this will cause inflate() to return immediately
  after the header and before the first block.  When doing a raw inflate,
  inflate() will go ahead and process the first block, and will return when it
  gets to the end of that block, or when it runs out of data.

    The Z_BLOCK option assists in appending to or combining deflate streams.
  Also to assist in this, on return inflate() will set strm->data_type to the
  number of unused bits in the last byte taken from strm->next_in, plus 64 if
  inflate() is currently decoding the last block in the deflate stream, plus
  128 if inflate() returned immediately after decoding an end-of-block code or
  decoding the complete header up to just before the first byte of the deflate
  stream.  The end-of-block will not be indicated until all of the uncompressed
  data from that block has been written to strm->next_out.  The number of
  unused bits may in general be greater than seven, except when bit 7 of
  data_type is set, in which case the number of unused bits will be less than
  eight.  data_type is set as noted here every time inflate() returns for all
  flush options, and so can be used to determine the amount of currently
  consumed input in bits.

    The Z_TREES option behaves as Z_BLOCK does, but it also returns when the
  end of each deflate block header is reached, before any actual data in that
  block is decoded.  This allows the caller to determine the length of the
  deflate block header for later use in random access within a deflate block.
  256 is added to the value of strm->data_type when inflate() returns
  immediately after reaching the end of the deflate block header.

    inflate() should normally be called until it returns Z_STREAM_END or an
  error.  However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step (a
  single call of inflate), the parameter flush should be set to Z_FINISH.  In
  this case all pending input is processed and all pending output is flushed;
  avail_out must be large enough to hold all of the uncompressed data for the
  operation to complete.  (The size of the uncompressed data may have been
  saved by the compressor for this purpose.) The use of Z_FINISH is not
  required to perform an inflation in one step.  However it may be used to
  inform inflate that a faster approach can be used for the single inflate()
  call.  Z_FINISH also informs inflate to not maintain a sliding window if the
  stream completes, which reduces inflate's memory footprint.  If the stream
  does not complete, either because not all of the stream is provided or not
  enough output space is provided, then a sliding window will be allocated and
  inflate() can be called again to continue the operation as if Z_NO_FLUSH had
  been used.

     In this implementation, inflate() always flushes as much output as
  possible to the output buffer, and always uses the faster approach on the
  first call.  So the effects of the flush parameter in this implementation are
  on the return value of inflate() as noted below, when inflate() returns early
  when Z_BLOCK or Z_TREES is used, and when inflate() avoids the allocation of
  memory for a sliding window when Z_FINISH is used.

     If a preset dictionary is needed after this call (see inflateSetDictionary
  below), inflate sets strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of the dictionary
  chosen by the compressor and returns Z_NEED_DICT; otherwise it sets
  strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of all output produced so far (that is,
  total_out bytes) and returns Z_OK, Z_STREAM_END or an error code as described
  below.  At the end of the stream, inflate() checks that its computed adler32
  checksum is equal to that saved by the compressor and returns Z_STREAM_END
  only if the checksum is correct.

    inflate() can decompress and check either zlib-wrapped or gzip-wrapped
  deflate data.  The header type is detected automatically, if requested when
  initializing with inflateInit2().  Any information contained in the gzip
  header is not retained, so applications that need that information should
  instead use raw inflate, see inflateInit2() below, or inflateBack() and
  perform their own processing of the gzip header and trailer.  When processing
  gzip-wrapped deflate data, strm->adler32 is set to the CRC-32 of the output
  producted so far.  The CRC-32 is checked against the gzip trailer.

    inflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input processed
  or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if the end of the compressed data has
  been reached and all uncompressed output has been produced, Z_NEED_DICT if a
  preset dictionary is needed at this point, Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was
  corrupted (input stream not conforming to the zlib format or incorrect check
  value), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent (for example
  next_in or next_out was Z_NULL), Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough memory,
  Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible or if there was not enough room in the
  output buffer when Z_FINISH is used.  Note that Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, and
  inflate() can be called again with more input and more output space to
  continue decompressing.  If Z_DATA_ERROR is returned, the application may
  then call inflateSync() to look for a good compression block if a partial
  recovery of the data is desired.

                                     int  strategy);

     This is another version of deflateInit with more compression options.  The
   fields next_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by the
   caller.

     The method parameter is the compression method.  It must be Z_DEFLATED in
   this version of the library.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the window size
   (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for this
   version of the library.  Larger values of this parameter result in better
   compression at the expense of memory usage.  The default value is 15 if
   deflateInit is used instead.

     windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw deflate.  In this case, -windowBits
   determines the window size.  deflate() will then generate raw deflate data
   with no zlib header or trailer, and will not compute an adler32 check value.

     windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip encoding.  Add
   16 to windowBits to write a simple gzip header and trailer around the
   compressed data instead of a zlib wrapper.  The gzip header will have no
   file name, no extra data, no comment, no modification time (set to zero), no
   header crc, and the operating system will be set to 255 (unknown).  If a
   gzip stream is being written, strm->adler is a crc32 instead of an adler32.

     The memLevel parameter specifies how much memory should be allocated
   for the internal compression state.  memLevel=1 uses minimum memory but is
   slow and reduces compression ratio; memLevel=9 uses maximum memory for
   optimal speed.  The default value is 8.  See zconf.h for total memory usage
   as a function of windowBits and memLevel.

     The strategy parameter is used to tune the compression algorithm.  Use the
   value Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal data, Z_FILTERED for data produced by a
   filter (or predictor), Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY to force Huffman encoding only (no
   string match), or Z_RLE to limit match distances to one (run-length
   encoding).  Filtered data consists mostly of small values with a somewhat
   random distribution.  In this case, the compression algorithm is tuned to
   compress them better.  The effect of Z_FILTERED is to force more Huffman
   coding and less string matching; it is somewhat intermediate between
   Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY and Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY.  Z_RLE is designed to be almost as
   fast as Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY, but give better compression for PNG image data.  The
   strategy parameter only affects the compression ratio but not the
   correctness of the compressed output even if it is not set appropriately.
   Z_FIXED prevents the use of dynamic Huffman codes, allowing for a simpler
   decoder for special applications.

     deflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if any parameter is invalid (such as an invalid
   method), or Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version (zlib_version) is
   incompatible with the version assumed by the caller (ZLIB_VERSION).  msg is
   set to null if there is no error message.  deflateInit2 does not perform any
   compression: this will be done by deflate().

/*
     Initializes the compression dictionary from the given byte sequence
   without producing any compressed output.  When using the zlib format, this
   function must be called immediately after deflateInit, deflateInit2 or
   deflateReset, and before any call of deflate.  When doing raw deflate, this
   function must be called either before any call of deflate, or immediately
   after the completion of a deflate block, i.e. after all input has been
   consumed and all output has been delivered when using any of the flush
   options Z_BLOCK, Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, or Z_FULL_FLUSH.  The
   compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same dictionary (see
   inflateSetDictionary).

     The dictionary should consist of strings (byte sequences) that are likely
   to be encountered later in the data to be compressed, with the most commonly
   used strings preferably put towards the end of the dictionary.  Using a
   dictionary is most useful when the data to be compressed is short and can be
   predicted with good accuracy; the data can then be compressed better than
   with the default empty dictionary.

     Depending on the size of the compression data structures selected by
   deflateInit or deflateInit2, a part of the dictionary may in effect be
   discarded, for example if the dictionary is larger than the window size
   provided in deflateInit or deflateInit2.  Thus the strings most likely to be
   useful should be put at the end of the dictionary, not at the front.  In
   addition, the current implementation of deflate will use at most the window
   size minus 262 bytes of the provided dictionary.

     Upon return of this function, strm->adler is set to the adler32 value
   of the dictionary; the decompressor may later use this value to determine
   which dictionary has been used by the compressor.  (The adler32 value
   applies to the whole dictionary even if only a subset of the dictionary is
   actually used by the compressor.) If a raw deflate was requested, then the
   adler32 value is not computed and strm->adler is not set.

     deflateSetDictionary returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if a
   parameter is invalid (e.g.  dictionary being Z_NULL) or the stream state is
   inconsistent (for example if deflate has already been called for this stream
   or if not at a block boundary for raw deflate).  deflateSetDictionary does
   not perform any compression: this will be done by deflate().

   If the compression level is changed, the input available so far is
   compressed with the old level (and may be flushed); the new level will take
   effect only at the next call of deflate().

     Before the call of deflateParams, the stream state must be set as for
   a call of deflate(), since the currently available input may have to be
   compressed and flushed.  In particular, strm->avail_out must be non-zero.

extern int inflateInit2 (z_streamp strm,
                                     int  windowBits);

     This is another version of inflateInit with an extra parameter.  The
   fields next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized
   before by the caller.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the maximum window
   size (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for
   this version of the library.  The default value is 15 if inflateInit is used
   instead.  windowBits must be greater than or equal to the windowBits value
   provided to deflateInit2() while compressing, or it must be equal to 15 if
   deflateInit2() was not used.  If a compressed stream with a larger window
   size is given as input, inflate() will return with the error code
   Z_DATA_ERROR instead of trying to allocate a larger window.

     windowBits can also be zero to request that inflate use the window size in
   the zlib header of the compressed stream.

     windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw inflate.  In this case, -windowBits
   determines the window size.  inflate() will then process raw deflate data,
   not looking for a zlib or gzip header, not generating a check value, and not
   looking for any check values for comparison at the end of the stream.  This
   is for use with other formats that use the deflate compressed data format
   such as zip.  Those formats provide their own check values.  If a custom
   format is developed using the raw deflate format for compressed data, it is
   recommended that a check value such as an adler32 or a crc32 be applied to
   the uncompressed data as is done in the zlib, gzip, and zip formats.  For
   most applications, the zlib format should be used as is.  Note that comments
   above on the use in deflateInit2() applies to the magnitude of windowBits.

     windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip decoding.  Add
   32 to windowBits to enable zlib and gzip decoding with automatic header
   detection, or add 16 to decode only the gzip format (the zlib format will
   return a Z_DATA_ERROR).  If a gzip stream is being decoded, strm->adler is a
   crc32 instead of an adler32.

     inflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible with the
   version assumed by the caller, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the parameters are
   invalid, such as a null pointer to the structure.  msg is set to null if
   there is no error message.  inflateInit2 does not perform any decompression
   apart from possibly reading the zlib header if present: actual decompression
   will be done by inflate().  (So next_in and avail_in may be modified, but
   next_out and avail_out are unused and unchanged.) The current implementation
   of inflateInit2() does not process any header information -- that is
   deferred until inflate() is called.
